### What is EqiBuild?
EqiBuild is meant to be a decentralised app focused on helping to simplify the way the government spends the tax payers' money. By using the app or website, people can fund projects that they believe actually benefit the community and their surrounding area using XLM. For example, if a local government had multiple projects but strict funding, like choosing between a new park for a specific area or improved roads, people could vote with their money and decide what gets built.

### Features
-**Micro-Contribution Support:** Leverage Stellar’s low transaction costs to facilitate small donations from individuals globally. It also allows users to contribute any amount, making it accessible for everyone.

-**Smart Contract Integration:** Smart contracts are used to release funds based on project milestones, ensuring accountability and progress tracking. This also means it can automatically refund contributors if a project fails to meet its milestones or is abandoned.

-**Project Tracking and Reporting:** Provide regular updates on project milestones, including images and reports on project status. This will also include project funding progress so people can see how close a project is to getting funding.

-**Partnerships and Collaborations:** Partnerships can be integrated with businesses that want to contribute to community projects, possibly in exchange for advertising or CSR benefits. This also applies for charities who can be funded or choose to fund community projects

### Roadmap

- [ ] Design token standards and metadata to represent infrastructure project contributions on Stellar
- [ ] Create a tiered crowdfunding structure using Stellar smart contracts to release funds upon milestone completion
- [ ] Connect the frontend with Stellar’s blockchain for low-fee micro-contributions and real-time transaction confirmation
- [ ] Allow token holders to vote on project priorities and fund distribution using Stellar smart contracts
- [ ] Use smart contracts to release funds only when project milestones are verified through community or system validation
- [ ] Implement ERC-3643 token system where contributors receive tokenized rewards and perks for their participation
- [ ] Develop a mobile and web dApp to facilitate global contributions with Stellar’s cost-efficient infrastructure
- [ ] Use IPFS to store and make accessible project documentation, updates, and progress reports
- [ ] Leverage Stellar’s Anchor system for easy fiat-to-crypto conversions to enable global participation
- [ ] Launch a beta version with select projects, gather feedback, and refine platform features
