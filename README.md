### What is EqiBuild?
EqiBuild is meant to be a decentralised app focused on helping to simplify the way the government spends the tax payers' money. By using the app or website, people can fund projects that they believe actually benefit the community and their surrounding area using XLM. For example, if a local government had multiple projects but strict funding, like choosing between a new park for a specific area or improved roads, people could vote with their money and decide what gets built.

### Features
-**Micro-Contribution Support:** Leverage Stellar’s low transaction costs to facilitate small donations from individuals globally. It also allows users to contribute any amount, making it accessible for everyone.

-**Smart Contract Integration:** Smart contracts are used to release funds based on project milestones, ensuring accountability and progress tracking. This also means it can automatically refund contributors if a project fails to meet its milestones or is abandoned.

-**Project Tracking and Reporting:** Provide regular updates on project milestones, including images and reports on project status. This will also include project funding progress so people can see how close a project is to getting funding.

-**Partnerships and Collaborations:** Partnerships can be integrated with businesses that want to contribute to community projects, possibly in exchange for advertising or CSR benefits. This also applies for charities who can be funded or choose to fund community projects
